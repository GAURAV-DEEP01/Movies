# Movies
Personal project (warning! : pyramid of doom ahead)

I used two movie API's here one from rapid API and the other one from Omdb website to understand how API's actually work 
## Topics covered
- eventloop
- API use
- promise 

### note:
The search feature on github pages kinda dosent work because its http not https github allows https

It works on a diffrent domain though!
